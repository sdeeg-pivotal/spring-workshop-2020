= Pivotal Cloud Native Applications Workshop
== Overview
[.lead]
This one day, hands-on, classroom style session will provide developers with experience building cloud native applications using micro service architectures, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud. The session includes presentations, demos, and hands on labs.

Below is a sample agenda.  It makes for a packed day, and we work with clients to tailor an agenda that fits
their needs.  We will cut, add, and/or split these topics as necessary.
